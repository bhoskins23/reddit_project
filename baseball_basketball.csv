baseball,"I took the liberty to make a simple scatterplot in Matplotlib because I wanted to see just how badly Kershaw stands out from the pack in terms of his postseason compatriots.

Kershaw is one of only 29 pitchers in MLB history to log more than 100 postseason innings. That's actually quite significant.

But that's about where the good stories end. Because as you will see in the following visualization, no one else who logged more than 100 postseason innings really comes close to his ineptitude:

Here's the full table, sorted by ERA ascending:

That's *really* bad. In the 100+ postseason IP club, Kershaw has the worst postseason ERA of the bunch. He is one of only two pitchers to clear 4.00 in the ERA category. And CC Sabathia, that other guy, was key to winning the 2009 WS. And yes, I know that everyone is going to now complain that 2017 happened. I say this in response: in a universe where the Astros didn't cheat in 2017, they likely wouldn't have made the WS. And that means the Dodgers would've been matched up against someone different that year, a team they very well could've also lost that year's WS against. On this basis alone, I will not rewrite the record books.

Maybe Kershaw gets another chance this series if the Dodgers pull off the miracle 3-1 series comeback. If the Dodgers save this NLCS and win the WS, then all would be forgiven. But otherwise, this is going to be a very tough legacy to live with.

The Dodgers are likely going to more postseasons in the upcoming years, but I think it's safe to say that while there have been other roadblocks to the Dodgers winning the WS, Clayton Kershaw continually putting up stinkers in the postseason is arguably the largest of them all. You can say that Kershaw received little run support at times thanks to untimely chokes by Dodger batters, but that's a pretty weak excuse to me because it in no way forgives a 4.31 career postseason ERA over a relatively massive sample size of innings pitched.

People say legacies are made in the postseason. And sadly, as of today, this is where Kershaw falls several miles short.",A damning visualization of Kershaw's postseason performance

baseball,"After seeing [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/jc269m/sportsnet_stats_clayton_kershaws_431_career_era/) about Kershaw's postseason ERA, I saw some people asking for the postseason leaderboard. I thought that'd be easy to find, but the only postseason leaderboards only showed the top 10. We want to know more about more pitchers similar to Kershaw, not in the top ten, so I had to generate that myself.

First, I used baseball-reference's postseason event finder to find the pitchers with the most postseason ""any batter out"" to find the list of most IP. It wasn't perfect to get ERA but I was able to modify it to get a good list. [Looks like this](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/336915824617062420/766647519340920892/unknown.png?width=366&amp;height=375)

Then, I whipped up some quick python code to query MLB.com's API to grab each pitcher's postseason stats. [link to code](https://github.com/efitz11/natsgifbot/blob/master/random_stuff/postseason_stats.py)

And so here is the leaderboard by ERA (I also included HR because I saw that stat in another post as well):

baseball,"I took the liberty to make a simple scatterplot in Matplotlib because I wanted to see just how badly Kershaw stands out from the pack in terms of his postseason compatriots.

Kershaw is one of only 29 pitchers in MLB history to log more than 100 postseason innings. That's actually quite significant.

But that's about where the good stories end. Because as you will see in the following visualization, no one else who logged more than 100 postseason innings really comes close to his ineptitude:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/umx271o3dht51.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc931319b5d92686120df27363f740994f52a5be

Here's the full table, sorted by ERA ascending:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aj8cbla7dht51.png?width=478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11630613e9ba30024a843173b8b7e7c2e6057ed4

That's *really* bad. In the 100+ postseason IP club, Kershaw has the worst postseason ERA of the bunch. He is one of only two pitchers to clear 4.00 in the ERA category. And CC Sabathia, that other guy, was key to winning the 2009 WS. And yes, I know that everyone is going to now complain that 2017 happened. I say this in response: in a universe where the Astros didn't cheat in 2017, they likely wouldn't have made the WS. And that means the Dodgers would've been matched up against someone different that year, a team they very well could've also lost that year's WS against. On this basis alone, I will not rewrite the record books.

Maybe Kershaw gets another chance this series if the Dodgers pull off the miracle 3-1 series comeback. If the Dodgers save this NLCS and win the WS, then all would be forgiven. But otherwise, this is going to be a very tough legacy to live with.

The Dodgers are likely going to more postseasons in the upcoming years, but I think it's safe to say that while there have been other roadblocks to the Dodgers winning the WS, Clayton Kershaw continually putting up stinkers in the postseason is arguably the largest of them all. You can say that Kershaw received little run support at times thanks to untimely chokes by Dodger batters, but that's a pretty weak excuse to me because it in no way forgives a 4.31 career postseason ERA over a relatively massive sample size of innings pitched.

People say legacies are made in the postseason. And sadly, as of today, this is where Kershaw falls several miles short.",A damning visualization of Kershaw's postseason performance

baseball,"After seeing [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/jc269m/sportsnet_stats_clayton_kershaws_431_career_era/) about Kershaw's postseason ERA, I saw some people asking for the postseason leaderboard. I thought that'd be easy to find, but the only postseason leaderboards only showed the top 10. We want to know more about more pitchers similar to Kershaw, not in the top ten, so I had to generate that myself.

First, I used baseball-reference's postseason event finder to find the pitchers with the most postseason ""any batter out"" to find the list of most IP. It wasn't perfect to get ERA but I was able to modify it to get a good list. [Looks like this](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/336915824617062420/766647519340920892/unknown.png?width=366&amp;height=375)

Then, I whipped up some quick python code to query MLB.com's API to grab each pitcher's postseason stats. [link to code](https://github.com/efitz11/natsgifbot/blob/master/random_stuff/postseason_stats.py)

And so here is the leaderboard by ERA (I also included HR because I saw that stat in another post as well):

What about different pitches? Did they have cutters, sliders and knuckleballs as well or are they more of a 80's-present type of pitch?

Yes, this all came from a discussion of what happened if you took a great hitter and put him back in time, how would he do?

baseball,,"Warren Cromartie gives Nagoya Dragons pitcher Masami Miyashita a taste of his own medicine, 1987"
baseball,,"No fancy graphic to go with it, but here‚Äôs my idea for MLB realignment if my two favorite expansion proposals made the leagues."
baseball,"I thought this was a neat occurrence, so I scoured through Baseball Reference and Stathead to find other instances of games where the home team hit a lead off home run on the first pitch as well as walked off the game.

Unfortunately, the data on these sites is not always reliable pre-1973, nor does it include some important information like pitch count, so it's quite possible that this has happened more than just 5 times, but we'll never really know for sure.

In any case, here is a table of all the times this has happened since 1973.

Date | Winning Team | Losing Team | Lead Off HR | Walk Off HR | Final Score
---|---|----|----|----|----
6/26/1979 | San Francisco Giants | Atlanta Braves | Bill North | Darrell Evans | SFG 6 - 5 ATL
5/23/2000 | Baltimore Orioles | Seattle Mariners | Brady Anderson | Cal Ripken Jr. | BAL 4 - 2 SEA
6/7/2006 | Seattle Mariners | Minnesota Twins | Ichiro Suzuki | Carl Everett | SEA 10 - 9 MIN
8/17/2008 | Los Angeles Dodgers | Milwaukee Brewers | Matt Kemp | Andre Ethier | LAD 7 - 5 MIL
10/15/2020 | Houston Astros | Tampa Bay Rays | George Springer | Carlos Correa | HOU 4 - 3 TBR

This is also the first time this has ever happened in a post-season game, which makes it special in its own right. I'm amazed that all 5 of these games were pretty close!",The Astros are only the 5th team since 1973 to hit a home run on both their first and last pitches of the game
baseball,,Fox Sports analysis before the Braves/Dodgers game.
baseball,"This probably gets brought up a lot.  But why does moneyball ignore the fact that those ‚Äúpast their time‚Äù scouts identified zito, Mulder, Harang and Hudson, which already made a ridiculous pitching staff, while also having juiced to the gills Tejada jacking home runs and possibly the same with chavez, btw also both probably identified by the ‚Äúin the past‚Äù scouts.  But all we hear is how it was all moneyball and converting a catcher to first baseman and signing a submarine pitcher was so groundbreaking.  I‚Äôve never bought it, it was already a solid team.",There was more to it than just ‚ÄúMoneyball‚Äù

baseball,"First, after Justin Turner's HBP yesterday I really hope the Dodgers watch the world series on TV. Second, once upon a time I played competitive tennis and at one point had an eye exam and a new prescription. A few days later playing with new glasses I swung at a routine volley and missed it completely. Tennis rackets are much much larger than bats, and yet I managed to miss the racket entirely. If I managed the Dodgers I would be taking a serious look at Beatty's glasses.

Absolutely no excuse for him just standing there and doing nothing after the miss however.",In Defense of Matt Beaty
baseball,"I love the Extra 2%, the crazy payroll disparity, and the Rays as an organization. I think the Dodgers clearly have the best team and deserve to win this year. But it would be hilarious to me if the Astros win in spite of all the hate they receive and all the players they‚Äôve lost to FA and injuries. I think it is fair to assume they are no longer cheating or else they‚Äôd risk being banned for life (and perhaps worse outcomes in court). It would be such a big F-U to win again. in my mind they are the de facto heels of the MLB. Imagine the delicious drama of seeing Darth Bregman smashing a top of the 9th inning grand slam to crush the Dodgers at the end of a 5 game world series. I only wish there weren‚Äôt a pandemic so we could see the boos rain down when they got their trophy. Too bad they are probably gonna lose against the Rays (whose story is far more uplifting and I would love to see them win as well of course)",It would be hilarious if the Astros win the WS

baseball,"I took the liberty to make a simple scatterplot in Matplotlib because I wanted to see just how badly Kershaw stands out from the pack in terms of his postseason compatriots.

Kershaw is one of only 29 pitchers in MLB history to log more than 100 postseason innings. That's actually quite significant.

But that's about where the good stories end. Because as you will see in the following visualization, no one else who logged more than 100 postseason innings really comes close to his ineptitude:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/umx271o3dht51.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc931319b5d92686120df27363f740994f52a5be

Here's the full table, sorted by ERA ascending:

That's *really* bad. In the 100+ postseason IP club, Kershaw has the worst postseason ERA of the bunch. He is one of only two pitchers to clear 4.00 in the ERA category. And CC Sabathia, that other guy, was key to winning the 2009 WS. And yes, I know that everyone is going to now complain that 2017 happened. I say this in response: in a universe where the Astros didn't cheat in 2017, they likely wouldn't have made the WS. And that means the Dodgers would've been matched up against someone different that year, a team they very well could've also lost that year's WS against. On this basis alone, I will not rewrite the record books.

Maybe Kershaw gets another chance this series if the Dodgers pull off the miracle 3-1 series comeback. If the Dodgers save this NLCS and win the WS, then all would be forgiven. But otherwise, this is going to be a very tough legacy to live with.

The Dodgers are likely going to more postseasons in the upcoming years, but I think it's safe to say that while there have been other roadblocks to the Dodgers winning the WS, Clayton Kershaw continually putting up stinkers in the postseason is arguably the largest of them all. You can say that Kershaw received little run support at times thanks to untimely chokes by Dodger batters, but that's a pretty weak excuse to me because it in no way forgives a 4.31 career postseason ERA over a relatively massive sample size of innings pitched.

People say legacies are made in the postseason. And sadly, as of today, this is where Kershaw falls several miles short.",A damning visualization of Kershaw's postseason performance

baseball,"After seeing [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/jc269m/sportsnet_stats_clayton_kershaws_431_career_era/) about Kershaw's postseason ERA, I saw some people asking for the postseason leaderboard. I thought that'd be easy to find, but the only postseason leaderboards only showed the top 10. We want to know more about more pitchers similar to Kershaw, not in the top ten, so I had to generate that myself.

First, I used baseball-reference's postseason event finder to find the pitchers with the most postseason ""any batter out"" to find the list of most IP. It wasn't perfect to get ERA but I was able to modify it to get a good list. [Looks like this](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/336915824617062420/766647519340920892/unknown.png?width=366&amp;height=375)

Then, I whipped up some quick python code to query MLB.com's API to grab each pitcher's postseason stats. [link to code](https://github.com/efitz11/natsgifbot/blob/master/random_stuff/postseason_stats.py)

And so here is the leaderboard by ERA (I also included HR because I saw that stat in another post as well):

baseball,,"Warren Cromartie gives Nagoya Dragons pitcher Masami Miyashita a taste of his own medicine, 1987"
baseball,,"No fancy graphic to go with it, but here‚Äôs my idea for MLB realignment if my two favorite expansion proposals made the leagues."
baseball,"I thought this was a neat occurrence, so I scoured through Baseball Reference and Stathead to find other instances of games where the home team hit a lead off home run on the first pitch as well as walked off the game.

Unfortunately, the data on these sites is not always reliable pre-1973, nor does it include some important information like pitch count, so it's quite possible that this has happened more than just 5 times, but we'll never really know for sure.

In any case, here is a table of all the times this has happened since 1973.

Date | Winning Team | Losing Team | Lead Off HR | Walk Off HR | Final Score
---|---|----|----|----|----
6/26/1979 | San Francisco Giants | Atlanta Braves | Bill North | Darrell Evans | SFG 6 - 5 ATL
5/23/2000 | Baltimore Orioles | Seattle Mariners | Brady Anderson | Cal Ripken Jr. | BAL 4 - 2 SEA
6/7/2006 | Seattle Mariners | Minnesota Twins | Ichiro Suzuki | Carl Everett | SEA 10 - 9 MIN
8/17/2008 | Los Angeles Dodgers | Milwaukee Brewers | Matt Kemp | Andre Ethier | LAD 7 - 5 MIL
10/15/2020 | Houston Astros | Tampa Bay Rays | George Springer | Carlos Correa | HOU 4 - 3 TBR

This is also the first time this has ever happened in a post-season game, which makes it special in its own right. I'm amazed that all 5 of these games were pretty close!",The Astros are only the 5th team since 1973 to hit a home run on both their first and last pitches of the game
baseball,,Fox Sports analysis before the Braves/Dodgers game.
baseball,"This probably gets brought up a lot.  But why does moneyball ignore the fact that those ‚Äúpast their time‚Äù scouts identified zito, Mulder, Harang and Hudson, which already made a ridiculous pitching staff, while also having juiced to the gills Tejada jacking home runs and possibly the same with chavez, btw also both probably identified by the ‚Äúin the past‚Äù scouts.  But all we hear is how it was all moneyball and converting a catcher to first baseman and signing a submarine pitcher was so groundbreaking.  I‚Äôve never bought it, it was already a solid team.",There was more to it than just ‚ÄúMoneyball‚Äù
baseball,,Can the Rays still win the ALCS?
baseball,[removed],Can the Rays still come back and win the ALCS?
baseball,,Morosi: Astros have embraced being the villain
baseball,A lot of people give him slander for not winning a ring despite how great he is. Of course it's mostly not his fault but imagine if he wins one. How big would his legacy be boosted?,"If Mike Trout won a ring before he retires, how would the baseball community react?"
baseball,"First, after Justin Turner's HBP yesterday I really hope the Dodgers watch the world series on TV. Second, once upon a time I played competitive tennis and at one point had an eye exam and a new prescription. A few days later playing with new glasses I swung at a routine volley and missed it completely. Tennis rackets are much much larger than bats, and yet I managed to miss the racket entirely. If I managed the Dodgers I would be taking a serious look at Beatty's glasses.

Absolutely no excuse for him just standing there and doing nothing after the miss however.",In Defense of Matt Beaty
baseball,"I love the Extra 2%, the crazy payroll disparity, and the Rays as an organization. I think the Dodgers clearly have the best team and deserve to win this year. But it would be hilarious to me if the Astros win in spite of all the hate they receive and all the players they‚Äôve lost to FA and injuries. I think it is fair to assume they are no longer cheating or else they‚Äôd risk being banned for life (and perhaps worse outcomes in court). It would be such a big F-U to win again. in my mind they are the de facto heels of the MLB. Imagine the delicious drama of seeing Darth Bregman smashing a top of the 9th inning grand slam to crush the Dodgers at the end of a 5 game world series. I only wish there weren‚Äôt a pandemic so we could see the boos rain down when they got their trophy. Too bad they are probably gonna lose against the Rays (whose story is far more uplifting and I would love to see them win as well of course)",It would be hilarious if the Astros win the WS
baseball,,It‚Äôs a shame we were deprived of this golden opportunity tonight
baseball,,"[Puma] Actual question to Marcell Ozuna postgame: ""During the game tonight, a TV announcer called you a 'monster.' If you describe yourself as a 'monster,' what kind of monster would you call yourself?"" Ozuna didn't have an answer."

baseball,,Ronald Acu√±a Celebrates Ozuna's Home Run in the 7th
baseball,Maybe I‚Äôll be that pitcher one day idk. Always average but completely resistant to injury or fatigue.,What would be the value of an average pitcher that could pitch all innings every game without getting injured or falling off?
baseball,"Well, that can't be good...",The Dodgers are 1-9 in postseason series in which they lost a game Kershaw appeared in
baseball,,Sums it up pretty nicely
baseball,[deleted],[Nightengale] Rookie Dustin May going Game 5 to try to save the #Dodgers season

baseball,,"Why do we continue to have to hear Alex Rodriguez's opinion? He's the worst no? Confused. Can he take drugs to talk better too, needs em more than he needed roids to hit the ball..."
baseball,,Bellinger is perplexed

baseball,"Out of genuine curiosity do many people find this chant offensive?  The Braves have had this for a long time and it feels like such a key part of watching the them at home. Even though the Braves themselves pulled the song and won‚Äôt play it anymore, the fans will always chant it.",I hear the Tomahawk Chop chant at the dodgers/Braves game.
baseball,The dodgers ‚Äúmomentum‚Äù did not help.,"Clayton Kershaw has lost his FIRST game against the Atlanta Braves in his ENTIRE career, in tonight‚Äôs Game 4 of the NLCS."

I know all the basic rules and stuff, I‚Äôve got that down pat. But the cultural aspects elude me... why does everyone hate the Astros, or the Yankees? What teams do people universally like, if any? What‚Äôs with the two different leagues? I know bugger all about that side of the game.

baseball,I know I‚Äôll probably get a ton of hate for this but hear me out. When was the last time we had a true villain in the mlb? Maybe A-rod? As much as people hate him he may actually be good for baseball RIGHT NOW. So many people who wouldn‚Äôt watch this rays and Astros series are probably tuning in to watch the Astros fail and more specifically Correa. Yet no can deny the clutch factor and talent of Correa and that he is fun to watch. Obviously the cheating scandal is why people hate him but he was pretty honest about who used the system and who didn‚Äôt and got people talking a lot about baseball which baseball desperately needed. I‚Äôm not saying cheating is good for baseball but to have a villain that people tune into to watch and talk about is a good thing.

I am going to attempt to make the best baseball uniforms ever in MLB the Show and have made a list of requirements that I‚Äôve seen people praise and hate about uniforms. I need your help adding and subtracting things from the list. Here it is:
PART 1: COLORS
1. Absolutely no navy blue or red.
2. People love teal. Use teal as a secondary color.
3. Use a unique color as a primary color (comment suggestions)

PART 2: LOGO AND TYPEFACE
1. Modern typeface. Either no outline around letters or only 1. No 90s or 00s fonts.
2. Logo should have hidden symbolism in it like the M and B in the brewers glove.
3. Keep it simple.
4. Use stylized font for numbers and name on back.
5. No minor league logos

PART 3: THE UNIFORM ITSELF
1. Needs a baby blue and cream alt, along with a teal one.
2. Use a different color than gray for the primary away (leave suggestions)
3. Pinstripes and piping is ok together as long as the piping isnt down the pants. 

PART 3.5: TEAM CITY AND NAME
1. Something cool üòé but traditional, not minor league-esque (leave suggestions)

Going to attempt to make this once the list is finalized and I have a name, primary color, and primary road jersey color. Its impossible to make a perfect jersey but as long as this appeals to 99% of people then its all good. üëç

Edit: I also need a list of the best players to model them.",Attempting to make the best baseball uniforms ever using MLB the Show

Not including this year's Rays, 35 teams have taken 3-0 leads in MLB history, and just one has blown one. The vast majority of 3-0 leads end in sweeps, so today was unusual. Only 20% of teams in a hole this big have managed to avoid a sweep, while only 6% have managed to force a game 6. If you win your fourth game when down 3-0, your odds of pulling off the reverse sweep still only increase to 14%.

P.S. The Yankees tend to be rather inconsiderate opponents","Out of curiosity, I looked up every 3-0 series lead in MLB history and checked the final results of the series"

baseball,"I'm not sure how home field would work in the future, but that's a side issue.

Having no off days makes teams have to keep their starters in longer, and it rewards teams that have depth, and they have to strategically use their best relievers.

Overall, the baseball looks more like normal baseball, and not the same 3 relievers in every game. And it gives the chance for classic outings by the starters.",MLB should keep the zero off day schedule for the DS and CS even after this year.

I am going to attempt to make the best baseball uniforms ever in MLB the Show and have made a list of requirements that I‚Äôve seen people praise and hate about uniforms. I need your help adding and subtracting things from the list. Here it is:
PART 1: COLORS
1. Absolutely no navy blue or red.
2. People love teal. Use teal as a secondary color.
3. Use a unique color as a primary color (comment suggestions)

PART 2: LOGO AND TYPEFACE
1. Modern typeface. Either no outline around letters or only 1. No 90s or 00s fonts.
2. Logo should have hidden symbolism in it like the M and B in the brewers glove.
3. Keep it simple.
4. Use stylized font for numbers and name on back.
5. No minor league logos

PART 3: THE UNIFORM ITSELF
1. Needs a baby blue and cream alt, along with a teal one.
2. Use a different color than gray for the primary away (leave suggestions)
3. Pinstripes and piping is ok together as long as the piping isnt down the pants. 

PART 3.5: TEAM CITY AND NAME
1. Something cool üòé but traditional, not minor league-esque (leave suggestions)

Going to attempt to make this once the list is finalized and I have a name, primary color, and primary road jersey color. Its impossible to make a perfect jersey but as long as this appeals to 99% of people then its all good. üëç",Attempting to make the best baseball uniforms ever in MLB the Show

baseball," What the hell have I gotten myself into?  
Amid what can only be categorized as a quarter-life crisis I have decided to venture out into the unknown and begin writing about baseball.  Bookended between a job I possess zero passion for and enjoying the side effects of being two and a half G&amp;T‚Äôs deep, I babbled to my girlfriend that if we hit the lottery I‚Äôd quit my job, become a baseball writer and follow around the Mets. While I‚Äôm aware its sad to have a dream that includes a baseball shaped mascot who has been ousted by Citi Field paparazzi for flipping off his own fans, I realized I can do half of that dream while simultaneously living my safe yet unrewarding desk job life. Even though the Mets managed to Mets it up this year and miss the playoffs in a season where more teams made the postseason than missed it, I‚Äòve done what no cool person has done before, I started my own baseball blog.   

  
How do you start a blog? Great question, I‚Äôm still working on filling in that answer but you‚Äòre invited to follow along with me as I embarrass myself, get roasted for formatting and get yelled at for not knowing what I'm talking about....I mean learn.   

  
Common sense told me to sit down, watch a game and write about so I said okay common sense, let‚Äôs watch Kershaw try and redeem the Dodgers tonight and get the postseason monkey off his back. While *diligently working my 9-5,* I got a Twitter update, the bomb of an update no Dodger fan wanted to see, ‚ÄúKershaw is scratched from Game 2 with back spasms. Tony Gonsolin will start in his place‚Äú Back spasms, fucking back spasms, BACK SPASMS...AGAIN! The 3x Cy Young award winner has been plagued by his back all decade long and in the biggest spot of 2020 when his team, down 1-0 in the NLCS, needed him the most, the baseball gods sent him straight to the trainer‚Äôs room.     
Unbelievable, my first game to write about and I‚Äôm deprived of covering the greatest pitcher of the past 10 years. Oh and it gets better, his replacement is the self proclaimed ‚ÄúCat Man‚Äù who emulates a middle aged divorc√©e with no children who puts tuna cans on her rickety back steps for her babies, aka neighborhood strays to eat. As cringeworthy as that special was, it was great to see Joe Buck and the rest of the broadcast attempt to break down his cat logo shirts and squirm as they each delivered their own censored version of ‚Äúwtf...‚Äù  
Regardless of his antics, Gonsolin did come out firing the first three innings and much like most Dodger prospects do, he left us wondering how the hell do they Dodgers continue to develop these kids?   
Gonsolin and rookie Ian Anderson matched zeroes the first three innings and despite working himself into some trouble due to walks, the Braves rookie was able to get out of a few bases loaded jams, thanks in large part to Austin Riley‚Äôs defensive work at third.   
Gonsolin retired the first 9 batters he faced  and seemed to be in cruise control until Ronald Acuna Jr. stepped in and drew a lead off walk to start the fourth. Great teams have a tendency to make pitchers pay for allowing lead off walks and that‚Äôs exactly what Freddie Freeman did when Gonsolin delivered a 3-2 off speed pitch over the inside of the plate. Freeman deposited it deep into the right field seats to break the scoreless game up and make it 2-0 Braves. The Dodger's starter was able to reel it back in and complete the rest of the inning unscathed but more trouble lurked in the 5th when Christian Pache ripped a double down the right field line for his first postseason hit and he made it count as Markakis came home to score from second, making it 3-0. The Braves didn‚Äôt stop there as Gonsolin began to lose control and LA turned to Pedro Baez to bail him out.   

Unfortunately for the Dodgers, Baez had control issues of his own and allowed an RBI hit to Freeman and then back to back walks to bring in a run. With the bases still loaded, Ozzie Albies delivered a shot to center but this one didn‚Äôt have the juice and Bellinger was able to haul it in, limiting the damage to a sac fly but the score stretched to 6-0. As the LA bats remained quiet the Braves took advantage of Alex Wood working an inning plus, as Dansby Swanson took a fastball down the right field line, past the reach of Betts and into the stands for a ground rule double.  Atlanta led 7-0 and the dugout was jumping after going up a touchdown (and an extra point).   

For the first time all game the Dodgers showed some energy after back to back hits by Joc Peterson and Chris Taylor.  Corey Seager gave his team some life as he took Darren O‚ÄôDay deep to left center field and tightened the gap to make it a 7-3 game. They had a chance again and they still had 8 more outs to play with.   

After failing to make anymore noise in the 7th or 8th, Dave Roberts turned the ball over to Adam Kolarek who quickly became a cog in a viral video when he gave up a solo shot to Albies that was somehow reeled in by Mark Melancon in the Braves bullpen for the SECON TIMES IN TWO NIGHTS! Sorry to anyone who is not a braves fan but those quirky Disney movie, feel good moments are made for World Series champion highlight reels, i.e. the David Ortiz home run and police officer celebration at Fenway.   

And just like that, I flipped the channel to the Rays-Astros game. I said I‚Äôll flip back to see the Braves finish them off and by the time I switched back Mookie was standing on first while Justin Turner struck out for the 2nd out in the bottom of the 9th with his team trailing 8-3.     
Then boom, Seager rips a double and coming all the way from first, Mookie casually crosses the plate standing to score, now it‚Äôs 8-4.   

Then boom, Muncy steps up and demolishes one deeeeep to right field and pimped it so good you would‚Äôve thought that it was Barry Bonds 756th after he passed Hank Aaron. Two runs in, now it‚Äôs 8-6 and you can feel the tide turning.  
Then Melancon gets taken out and Tomlin is in to face Will Smith. After a few twirls of his Double IPA dripping hipster mustache, Tomlin gets him to ground one to Albies at second and despite his offensive heroics in the top of the 9th, Ozzie fails to field it cleanly, bobbles it again on the pick up and boom Smith beats the throw at first and now the tying run is up to bat.   

Then Cody Bellinger steps up and rips the ball to right and after a sideways carom off the wall, he is sliding In safely at third as Smith comes around to score and now it‚Äôs 8-7 with the tying run just 90 feet away.   

Then stepping in is AJ Pollock and in what seemed to be the trend of the night for Los Angeles in big spots, he hits it to third to you guessed it, Austin Riley who fields the sharp ground ball cleanly and delivered a strike to Freeman to end the game and saving Braves fans from feeling the pain they‚Äôve been feeling from the falcons this year. Despite the drama, the sweat and the near choke, the Atlanta Braves now lead the NLCS 2-0 over the Los Angeles Dodgers and will look to continue their perfect postseason run Wednesday night.   

WHAT A GAME, seriously what a game. I sat there for three and a half hours thinking to myself just keep watching, if you‚Äôre going to do this you need to endure the tough ones and thank god I did because this is what baseball is all about. There's no play clock, there‚Äôs no shot clock, each team needs to get 27 outs and there is no guarantee that they are going to get them. I could not have asked for a better game to start covering.   

I hope at least one of you have enjoyed this or better yet, one of you actually made it this far. As mentioned earlier this is blog #1 and I'll continue to write them as the series continues.  Once I have a body of work I will open up my site for you to view for those interested in following.  If you have any comments or suggestions feel free to PM them over.

baseball,,Interview with famous player Tommy Coughlin
baseball,"I've spent the last 11 months (shoulda known when the hammer dropped in January 2020 that this was going to be a rough year) struggling to find a way to reconcile my 35+ year fandom with the reality that my team cheated on the way to a WS title. It has made me lose interest in the team and the sport at large. 

Part of me thinks that my passion won't return until the major players are gone. I have noticed the universal delight expressed when the Astros fail. Looking at the Altuve ""yips"" thread and its clear that everyone is pleased with his struggles. I get it, its karma.

My question is how do those with former Astros on their own team handle that? Guys like Marisnick, JD Davis, Tony Kemp, and Marwin Gonzalez were members of that team who had stolen signals relayed to them during ABs.  

Don't care? Root for them to fail? Ignore it? 

This isn't to say those guys deserve worse than they are getting, or that having one former Astro on your team puts us in similar situations.  Maybe I'm just looking for a method to excuse the inexcusable?

For what its worth, I'm not trying to make any point, I'm genuinely just curios. I went to my first Astros game in 1985 and have been obsessed ever since. I really want to have a team to feel good about again.",How do you feel about 2017 Astros on your team?

baseball,"Tonight might not be a Dusty Baker team's worst showing, but it was definitely the type of postseason game he has had the misfortune of managing.

Dusty Baker has overseen 63 postseason games. He's 28-36. Not *too* bad, until you consider that:

* Out of those 36 losses, his teams have blown a lead in 23 of them
* 11 of said blown leads occurred in the 6th inning or later
* He's 2-6 in winner-take-all postseason games games
* His teams have blown leads, sometimes very significant ones, in 4 of those 6 losses in winner-take-all games
* His teams have combined to blow 4 series in which they had a series lead and needed just 1 more win to advance or win the WS:
   * 2002 WS: the famous Russ Ortiz game (brief PTSD moments as a Giants fan)
   * 2003 NLCS: the Game 6 where Steve Bartman somehow got all the blame for an overall awful 8th-inning performance, not to mention another blown lead in Game 7, and the 3-1 blown series lead
   * 2012 NLDS: becomes the first manager to get reverse swept entirely at home in a 5-game series
   * 2016 NLDS: just classic Nationals pre-2019 choking

Dusty Baker may not be the most ill-stricken manager in the postseason, but he has definitely been a name that has been quite polarizing among fans. He'll usually lead your team to the postseason. But his teams always find some magical way of getting knocked out as well.

Of course, there's still a chance the Astros reverse sweep the rest of the way, but I'm not counting on that. They have not played good baseball this series; that's what meeting a team that actually knows what they're doing in the postseason will do to you (sorry Twins and A's, you don't really have a great postseason track record in the past couple decades). Should the Astros get eliminated this year, it would mark one of the quieter Baker postseason eliminations.

Not that Baker himself is enjoying any bit of this. Part of me feels for him because he had no business in the cheating scandal and has been forced to try and begin rebuilding the reputation of the Houston Astros organization. Yet, naive fans will look down on him simply by being associated with Houston in the first place.

Even though I have some bad memories of Baker myself, I do have to respect him for being bold enough to take on this job, even if it was largely because he didn't get any other coaching offers.",Dusty Baker: a legacy of failure

baseball,"Honestly, I was really excited when they picked it up, but the broadcasts were so bad I couldn‚Äôt keep watching. But I‚Äôve come back the last few weeks and now that they‚Äôve dropped the zoom call garbage it‚Äôs much better. It‚Äôs also far more interesting than the home run, strikeout, rinse and repeat fests that MLB has become. I really hope ESPN (or another American network) picks up KBO again next year.",Anyone Else Hope ESPN Keeps KBO Next Year?
baseball,"1) Springer, Brantley, Reddick, Verlander all gone next year anyway.
2) Trade Bergman, Altuve, Greinke, and others for top prospects. 
3) Keep anyone who wasn‚Äôt on the 2017 squad.
4) Hire someone like Jeff Luhnow (except not him)

Completely reload on talent at the minor leagues (Astros are utterly depleted). Rebuild and aim to win a championship in 2025.

*Game ended at 12:40 AM.*",Postgame Thread ‚öæ Rays 5 @ Astros 2
baseball,,Altuve is rung up on a check-swing strikeout call by the home plate umpire
baseball,"We had it coming, a very misfortunate but well deserved kick to the nuts from the baseball gods. Our luck has not been the greatest, but like I said, it is well deserved. We cheated, no matter how beneficial it was for our team, no matter if there were other organizations involved, what matters is that we cheated. Even though I understand that there will be a game four, the damage has already been done. Well done to the Rays, may the best of luck be with you.

Yours truly, a sad Astros fan",I‚Äôm ready to accept this karma that the baseball gods have given to the Astros in the ALCS.
baseball,,[Frank Thomas] replying to @DOBrien. Listen up David yes I said that! When top players get hit every player on the field wakes up. Especially the team whose been sleep walking all night. Retaliation sometime happens in big games. You notice how aware there at bats were after that point of the game.
baseball,,[Simon] Randy Arozarena becomes the 4th player in postseason history with 4 games of 3+ hits in the same postseason. The list:
baseball,,"[Graca] Astros are just 4-22 with RISP, with 29 left on the bags in this series #ALCS #Postseason"
baseball,,Randy Arozarena is the first rookie with four 3 hit games in the postseason
baseball,,"[John McClain] After winning this game, Rays should just put the Astros out of their misery tomorrow with a sweep and a well-deserved trip to the World Series."
baseball,,Renfroe comes up clutch with his second sliding catch of the night
baseball,,[Melancon] tag teams have each other's backs. So does this team #MixItUp
baseball,,[Gottlieb] Not sure my bosses at Fox will he fired up for Rays vs Braves. Manfred should consider bringing back the trash cans for Houston and giving the Dodgers some bullpen dispensation
baseball,,"Melancon catches homers, bodies reporters and wins Twitter."
baseball,"I don't know if I can keep doing it, being an Astros fan over the last year has been absolute hell. Right after you lose a game 7 at home you find out about your team's cheating allegations and think ""There's no way they actually did this right?"" well they did. Over a three month period you come to the horrible realization that the only championship that you've ever seen any of your teams win as Houstonian in your lifetime, is a lie. You don't know whether to defend your team that deep down you know did the worst thing you can possibly do in the world of sports, or whether to just be silent. Do you stop supporting the team that you've loved for so many years, pouring so much time and money into, or continue to support them and look like a fool. I haven't been able to wear any Astros merchandise in public since it became official that we did cheat. Everywhere I look it's cheaters this and trash cans that, it gets tiring. The Astros were a good team without cheating, just looking at their away records it's clear. Why they felt that they needed that edge in 2017 is beyond me. Even though they were only disciplined for 2017, they don't get the benefit of the doubt for their success in 2018 or 2019, and honestly I can't blame the skeptics. If they did it once why wouldn't they do it again. Fans have every right to be skeptical of 2 years between the championship\* and when they got caught. It would be one thing if they were just bad every year, but no, they disgraced the sport and made you feel like an absolute clown for supporting them. You thought your city had finally brought you a championship but no, it just gets ripped away from you two years later. As much as I love the Astros, I don't know if continuing to support them is the best option. I know that all the players on that 2017 team will eventually retire or leave, and I know that I can still appreciate the greatness of guys like Verlander or Cole or Keuchel. But I just don't have the same love or passion for this team that I used to. I thought I was a fan for life, but nobody ever thinks their team would do something this bad. Maybe in 5-10 years I won't be ashamed to be a fan, but as far as for right now, it's embarrassing.",Being an Astros Fan

baseball,"I‚Äôm honestly curious, because I‚Äôve never heard that take before.

baseball,,Joey Wendle gives the Rays the lead with a clutch 2 run single
baseball,"Am I the only one that thinks some of the post game analysis is super biased?  Instead of them talking about what the Braves did right, the talk about what the dodgers get wrong.

Do their arms just get tired too quickly? If so why is that? Are they trained to pitch in a way that they can't last more than an inning or two or is that just how they are built? For instance Aroldis Chapman started out as a starter (with the Reds?) but now he's a closer and rare for him to pitch more than a single inning. Did they just decide he was great for one inning but then couldn't give them length and so he goes on to become a top closer?,Can someone explain to me why pitchers become starters vs relievers vs closers?

baseball,"Last night I attended the Braves v. Dodgers at Globe Life Field in Arlington, TX. A bit of a mixed bag, but overall I would certainly call it a positive experience. 

I arrived to the ballpark a few hours before game time and had no trouble finding parking, basically parked directly next to the stadium. There was a ""no tailgating"" rule in effect, but it was pretty lax. As long as there weren't chairs, coolers, grills, or tailgates down you were able to stand around and have a couple beers. Security guards in golf carts were patrolling and the few violators were asked to comply with the rules and did so willingly. Tickets were sold in groups of fours and my group and I headed into the stadium about an hour prior to first pitch. Little to no line at the security gate, all employees were masked, gloved and very helpful. I was told masks were available if you were without. 

Once inside the park mask usage was pretty much 100% outside of a few folks who were eating or drinking. Social distancing was kind of concerning though. The gift shop appeared to be packed, and the concourse area was fairly crowded in areas. Concession areas were clearly marked with 6' markers and appeared to be adhered to. We did a quick walk around, it really is a nice ballpark. Open and bright, the roof was open and the weather was absolutely perfect. One very cool thing is Rangers PA guy Chuck Morgan aka  u/chuckranger83 has an area where you can watch him do his thing, and he even masked up and popped out to greet the fans. No sighting of /u/grubes1310 though. 

We headed to our seats. We were in section 114 right below Chuck's fishbowl, and hard to imagine a better seat for a ballgame. Sections of seats were available in groups of 4 and other seats were zip tied closed. The orientation of the open seats didn't seem optimal, but I certainly felt like there was plenty of space. Outside of those eating or drinking pretty much everybody wore their mask. Ushers had to offer a few friendly reminders to a few people but it was encouraging to see. That is until about the fifth inning. As the game progressed mask adherence really took a step back, both in seating areas and in the concourse. Seemed like people were just carrying around cups to avoid wearing a mask.

Pretty solid crowd and the back and forth dynamic of both teams fans being mostly equal was pretty cool. Nothing like the ground shaking roars of a usual playoff crowd but good energy none the less. Outside of one overzealous foul ball chaser I didn't see any fans trying to start trouble.

After the game the concourse was not really doing much in the way of social distancing and lots of improperly worn masks. Once out of the stadium all social distancing and masking went out the window. Just a sea of people coughing and smoking, and it was pretty much unavoidable. All that said it was so nice to be able to go to a ballgame again, and the new stadium is a fantastic place to watch a game.

TLDR:
The Stadium and ballpark experience at GLF are wonderful.
Safety protocols and social distancing were mostly successful, but kind of tailed off towards the end.","Going to a playoff game during a pandemic, my experience/AMA."

baseball,"Warning I am very biased but I would love to discuss this and see if I‚Äôm missing something important. 

For a while now, people (myself included) have used RISP and LOB to show how bad the Braves are with runners on. I mean they are second in LOB and the top 5 of that list are some pretty bad teams. This is used often to say the Braves just care about home runs and do not use situational hitting or sacrifice flys or whatever old school small ball plays that so many people love. I was in this same boat. It was frustrating to watch the Braves have a lead off hit or walk, or get someone to third on only to strike out the side. 

So this made me wonder. Why were the Braves winning games? Surely we are not hitting that many solo home runs? How can we be this good if we leave have such a high LOB? 

Well here‚Äôs some more stats. With runners on base, the Braves are first in RBIs, Hits, Runs, Doubles, Home runs! And are top Five in walks, AVG, OBP., SLG, and OPS!! 

Everyone just sees the high number of LOB and assumes the Braves must not score them, when it‚Äôs exactly opposite of that. 


TLDR::

Here‚Äôs the hot take. The Braves are winning because they are the best at getting on base and scoring!!

They get on base so much that they can get all those hits and RBIs and they still leave a ton of runners on!!

I would love to discuss and see if I‚Äôm completely misunderstanding the stats!",HOT TAKE: The Braves are the best team with RISP and LOB

&amp;#x200B;

Will this work? Why and why not?",Crazy/nonsense idea - Use a tennis serve and get a baseball batter to hit it
baseball,As a Marlins fan we do play the Ray's every year and I know they both don't have very much fan support but I'm hoping with the Marlins being more competitive and with the Rays already being one of the best teams in baseball im hoping a competitive rivalry builds. But I would either have to choose from the Braves due to the Acuna Jr incidents these past 2 years or the Phillies reporters calling the team bottom feeders and any team with Bryce Harper you want to play harder against and shut him down.,"For fans of teams that don't have traditionally historic rivalries such as the obvious Sox vs Yanks, Dodgers vs Giants etc who would you say is your team's rival? I'd love to hear some obscure ones and your reasoning."

baseball,,[Carrabis] THEY ASKED MAX FRIED ABOUT THE TIGHT PANTS TOO WHAT IS GOING ON
baseball,,I actually thought I was having a stroke.
baseball,"The issue isn‚Äôt likely to be apparent during the NLCS but can be a key advantage in the World Series, especially if the Astros advance. 

There‚Äôs two scenarios: 

* the Rays advance and have to play the World Series as the road team in every single game as they‚Äôd be going against much larger fanbases from the Braves or Dodgers. 

* the Astros advance and play about 4 hours away from their stadium and fan base. Essentially earning home field advantage every single game.",MLB allowing fans at Globe Life is kind of a dick move
